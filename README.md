# Binary Classification of Cancer data using PCA, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes

Introduction:

Using DNA microarray technology, it is possible to analyze the expression of thousands of genes at 
the same time, allowing for screening patients for genetic disorders or cancer. Depending on the 
genes expressed, one can determine whether cells are healthy or cancerous. Moreover, the type of 
cancer can also be determined from finding what genes are expressed. 

This model uses data  from  DNA microarrays performed on 72 patients. Each patient had one of two forms of leukemia: either acute 
myeloid  leukemia  (AML)  or  acute  lymphocytic  leukemia  (ALL).  The  DNA  microarrays 
performed tested for the presence and expression of 7,129 different genes (these are the features). 
The model is to predict what form of cancer (output) is present in a patient based on 
what genes are expressed (i.e., a binary classification problem).
